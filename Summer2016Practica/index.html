We are the global authority on all things chocolate. From chocolate bars to truffles, there is no higher standard for premium gourmet chocolate.
<br><br>
Din Mormor Chokolad is actually Swedish for "You're Grandma's Chocolate".
 We picked that name because we love our grandmothers. We cherished the weekends staying at her house. We remember the treats that she made for us with so much love and care.
 We understand the joy shown on her face whenever we said we loved her treats.
<br><br>
That is why we took the time out to be the greatest chocolatiers in the world. Those fond memories and delicious sweets are what fuel us.
 Our mission and solemn goal is to spread that same love all throughout the world with the same treats that made us smile all our life.
 So, now that you are craving the best sweets around, go ahead and let grandma take care of that sweet tooth.
